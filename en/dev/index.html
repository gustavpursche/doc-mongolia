A scarf around her nose and mouth keep the dust out that is raised when four hundred hooves trod unhurriedly through the desert sand. Panselma looks back, one of her goats has fallen back, and is chewing  on one of the parched bushes with some difficulty.</p>

      <p>The group is surrounded by the vast barren landscape of the Gobi desert: a panorama of pale, yellowish-orange sand, gravel, and ankle-high bushes as far as the eye can see. Only in one direction can a small elevation be made out on the horizon: "Mountain of the Chicken“ is the name of this hill, which has some spiritual meaning for the nomads. Once a year they gather from the entire region to pray to the holy ghost of the mountain for the good health of the people and their animals. Throughout the year the mountain has a different, slightly more practical importance: it serves the nomads, who travel without GPS or compass, as a landmark in the uniform plain.</p>

      <p>Panselma bends over the goat that has fallen behind. In the meantime the animal has laid down in the dust and is uttering strained noises. "Labor pain,“ Panselma explains. A few minutes later two small kids have plopped into the sand at her feet. She's glad: "They're both alive!“ In the previous year the goat mother, one of Panselmas favourites in the flock, experienced a stillbirth. This year there has been an unusual amount of twins born in Panselma's herd. But the siblings will not stay together for long: Panselma wants to give away some of the kids to those nomad families who have also had to cope with loss this year. Many of the nomads in Ulaanbadrakh complain about the generally deteriorated physical condition of their livestock. In nearly every yurt, people complain that the animals are fundamentally less resistant and “more stupid” than usual. Furthermore, stillbirths and mutations have become more and more common in the herds of the Aargalant nomads. So it's no surprise that Panselma is glad about every kid and lamb that is born alive.</p>

      <p>By early evening Panselma's husband Baasanbat arrives on his motorbike to collect the newborns. Panselma takes one of the kids herself and tries to persuade the dazed mother to follow her and the rest of the flock back to the yurt. After a while a small white dot appears at the foot of the desert mountain, the yurt. By nightfall Panselma and her flock arrive home.</p>

      <p>Exhausted Panselma collapses on to one of the two beds inside the tent-like nomadic home, where a fire of dried dung is already crackling.  Now March, it is the „Time of the Small Animals,“ the most strenuous time of year for the nomads. They're on delivery watch  all night, because, if left alone, newborn lambs and kids often die of exposure during the cold desert nights. This year the danger for Panselma's kids is particularly high. Normally a thick layer of insulating dung is has built up and covers the camp's ground, thus protecting the newborns from the ground's cold. However, Panselma's family and their animals have just moved to this place. Their old camp is about 30 kilometers away, on the other side of the "Mountain of the Chicken", but they didn't want to stay there; not since Areva has taken up residence there.</p>

          Like this one, many animals in the region are already dead when they're born. 2014 was a particularly bad year: one family lost 95 kids – 80 percent of the year's births.

          In our evening conversations with the Aargalants, we asked what the cause for these deformities could be. The answer most commonly heard in the yurts is "Areva." The French company pitched its camp in the region in 2010 and has been  testing an experimental method of extracting uranium from deep below the desert ground ever since.

      <p><span class="richtext_cap">T</span>he incidents in the area around Ulaanbadrakh were made public by Nosgurun. In November of 2012 he found the carcasses of four of his calves: "They were perfectly healthy!“ he exclaims. The sturdy man's voice wavers as he talks about the incident: "They must have just dropped dead.“</p>

      <h2 class="richtext_subheadline"
          id="dead_calfs">### TODO ###</h2>

      <p>When fifteen more animals died in the weeks that followed, Nosgurun became suspicious: "It must have to do with the water the animals drank,“ the nomad now supposes. He knew that other families had had issues with their animals too and wanted to solve the mystery of  his calves' deaths. So he wrote to the veterinary authority and a governmental complaints office in Ulaanbaatar.</p>

      <p>Nosgorun's submission came to the attention of Dr. Tserenchimed, head of the national veterinarian laboratory, who consequently traveled to Ulaanbadrakh to assess the situation. Tserenchimed took blood samples, examined the internal organs of slaughtered animals, and noted various tissue changes. The symptoms indicated a combination of poisoning, the veterinarian explained, caused by heavy metals and other elements as well as nuclear radiation.</p>

      <p>In a comparative study with animals from another region, Dr. Tserenchimed was unable to find similar abnormalities. This seems to substatiate the local nomads' hunch that Areva's activities might have something to do with their problems.</p>

      <p>For years Arevas Mongolian subsidiary, Kogegobi, prepared the exploitation of deep uranium reserves in Aargalant. In 2011 the first test drillings using the "In-Situ-Leaching" method took place. Just one year later the first wave of stillbirths and mutations in the nomads' livestock occurred. "No, before 2012 we didn't have problems" says Gantur, who has already experienced over 20 dead newborns in his flock this year. No one in the nomadic community of Ulaanbadrakh can recall that stillbirths have ever been more than an occasional occurrence before 2012. Now they have become the norm.</p>

      <p>Amarjargal Badarch works at the Dornogovi Department of Health. She says Areva should never have received permission to start drilling in the first place, since no comparative studies – for example of local wells – were made in advance. The local health office was  also never informed of the environmental impact assessment, which was allegedly carried out. Now, after years of test drilling, it has become difficult to find out anything substantive at all.</p>

      <p>Thus Dr. Tserenchimed's investigations are the only scientific data that has been gathered regarding the situation in Ulaanbardakh. However, he hasn't been allowed to publish his study. Moreover, the government removed him from his position as the head of the national veterinary medical laboratory. "The government has no interest in shedding any light on the occurrences in Ulaanbadrakh," complains Tserenchimed.</p>

      <p>Nonetheless, the renowned veterinarian, who is also chairman of the Mongolian National Counsel of Scientists, is far from giving up: of course, there are a whole range of factors, that worry the nomads in the Gobi desert and not all of them are connected to uranium extraction. Water scarcity as a result of climate change is a serious problem as well. At the same time, the boom in the country's mining of gold and copper, for example, has also had a serious impact on water quality. A hard-won law, regulating mining activities around rivers, was recently relaxed. However, nowhere else in Mongolia are people experiencing the kinds of things that the Ulaanbadrakh region is struggling with.</p>

      <p>A random sample strengthens what Dr. Tserenchemid has reported: Nosgurun slaughters a goat, then his sons carve up the animal in order to present the organs for the vet's inspection. "You can see considerable abnormalities  here“ the vet says and points at pale spots in the lung tissue. "That's not normal - and you can find this no matter which animal you look at here.“</p>

      <p>"At the same time the cases are also very different," says Dr. Tserenchmid. Nosgurun for example used to live in close proximity to a disposal site for low-level radioactive drilling mud, which Areva hadn't even fenced off at the time. It's conceivable that his deceased calves even drank from the mud pool there. The exact cause of death could never be determined. However, the eye problems that have become common among the goats and sheep in the Ulaanbadrakh region, represent a typical symptom of radiation exposure. Other symptoms point to heavy metal poisoning, which Dr. Tserenchimed also links to uranium mining in the region: t uranium is not only radioactive, but a highly toxic heavy metal as well. Additionally there are a multitude other toxic elements that could be released during the uranium extraction. "I'm positive that Areva's activities have something to do with the problems here" Dr. Tserenchimed sums up.</p>

Rusty pipe stumps, sticking up from the ground every few hundred meters, bear witness to Soviet explorations in the 1980s. Then, however, the explorers took only drilling cores; they never achieved a state of effective excavation.</p>

      <p>Around the turn of the millennium France became active in Mongolia and Areva started its own explorations in the Ulaanbadrakh area. The deposits of the "Sainshand Formation" are of the "roll front" type. In contrast to other deposits, where the uranium ore consists of solid rock, here the element is located inside a porous aquifer, a groundwater-carrying layer. This is the reason for the unconventional "In-Situ-Leaching" (<abbr title="In-Situ-Leaching">ISL</abbr>) extraction method..</p>

      <p>The remaining – albeit low-level – radioactive mud, was subsequently dumped by Areva onto two desert sites. First the mud formed a puddle, which presumably sealed the fate of Nosgurun's calves before drying up. Now that the water has evaporated or leeched back into the soil, there's there's no protection against wind dispersal of the remaining radioactive dust. The area surrounding Dulan Uul is as flat as a pancake, so the constantly recurring sand storms can carry toxic and radiating particles over very far distances. Also the danger of groundwater contamination due to ISL-extraction can hardly be eliminated. In fact, a survey at the end of 2013 found increased levels of uranium and other elements like selenium in various Aargalant wells.</p>

      <p>For Ariunbold and his wife Sarangerel, two nomads who live very close to the main Areva compound, the first problems with their livestock occurred in 2011 – immediately after Areva started testing its In-Situ-Leaching method. At the time, Panselma was living only 12 kilometers downwind from the compound: the first stillbirths in her herd occurred shortly thereafter in 2012, around the same time that Nosgorun's calves suddenly died.</p>

      <p>Proving without a doubt that Areva's test drilling led to the problems seen in the herds would require more research however. Not only is there a lack of political interest in discovering the truth, Mongolia also lacks the scientific facilities to conduct this research, explains Professor Tsabshir, the director of the Medical University of Sainshand. Therefore, the current situation makes it impossible to either prove or rule out a connection. His conclusion: "We're not ready for this technology."</p>

      <p><span class="richtext_cap">A</span>s with the increased incidences of leukemia in areas nearby German nuclear power plants, only statistics support the nomads' suspicions that Areva is to blame for the problems they're seeing in their herds. Too little research has been conducted so far and the effects of low-level radiation, which also occurs around nuclear power plants, have been disputed among nuclear medics and radiobiologists. Still, at the moment it remains impossible to rule out any detrimental health effects of low-level radiation in the area.</p>

      <p>Meanwhile, Areva has avoided the public debate, preferring to try and make the nomads dependent. Not one of the company's representatives in Mongolia was available for an interview. Areva representatives were expected to attend a conference at the Agricultural University of Ulaanbaatar and address the concerns about the situation in Ulaanbadrakh, but no one showed up. At the conference a lone voice spoke in defense of uranium extraction – a physics professor, sent by the state.</p>

      <p>In an attempt to show that the extraction activities were harmless, this scientist presented a study showing the absence of radioactive particles in and the overall innocuousness of camel milk in the Ulaanbadrakh region. Ironically, the study was conducted in 2008 – two years before Areva's ISL tests had even begun.</p>

      <p>While interviewing the Gerelt-Od family, whose herd lost almost all of their newborns in 2014, we're shown many photos of stillborn animals, but then a document with an Areva stamp turns up. The Gerelt-Od family is reluctant to show it to us. Areva's credit saved the family as it stood on the verge of ruin after their heavy losses. Their criticism of Areva, previously anything but a secret, became sparser afterwards. The other nomad families feel let down by them. The company, which repeatedly gives animals on credit to families with exceptionally high losses, calls it a measure to support economically weak families. It feels a little like an admission of guilt. A little like a well-calculated scheme to divide an otherwise cohesive anti-Areva movement.</p>

      <p>Sarangerel and Ariunbold have more or less given up. They consciously don't have any kids or lambs in their flock this year. "It's pointless anyway," says the elderly woman, combing a huge bundle of camel wool. The couple has instead decided to focus on the bigger animals, whose problems they say are not that severe. They intend to slowly sell off their goats and sheep and somehow live their lives out here. They are pessimistic about the future, if Areva really begins commercial extraction of uranium.</p>

      <p>Some kilometers further, the 58-year-old Jambalserun, one of the nomads' spokespeople, is optimistic that it's possible to drive Areva from their desert. He has high hopes after the referendum: Areva simply has to acknowledge it. Mongolia doesn't need uranium, he says. He has two photovoltaic cells in front of his yurt, which produce enough electricity to power his lights, TV, hi-fi equipment, and even a freezer. Jambalserun is confident that Mongolia can easily meet its energy demands with renewable energy sources.</p>

      <p>Panselma agrees, she also doesn't need the uranium – and neither does Mongolia. The only thing she needs is her ancestors' land. She is angry that Areva has compromised the peace of the desert and partly also the peace among the nomads. She's afraid of the consequences the nomadic community would have to face, if Areva really goes through with their plans to commercially extract uranium. Panselma wants to fight, as long as possible: "Until Areva is driven from the region!"</p>
